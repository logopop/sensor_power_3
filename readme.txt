This is the file tree needed for the power management CPU on the APRS board described on https://www.qrz.com/db/la1pca

The board schematic diagram and PCB layout in KiCad format is in a separate repo.

The build environment is Microchip MPLAB X IDE v5.50, Harmony v2.06, xc32 v2.41, and xc8 v2.36.

You will probably be able to build just fine with any updated Microchip toolchain and compiler versions.
